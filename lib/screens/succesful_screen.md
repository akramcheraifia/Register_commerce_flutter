Certainly! Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

The code defines a `SuccessfulScreen` class that extends `StatelessWidget`. This class represents a screen that is displayed when a form is successfully submitted. It takes an integer `formNumber` as a parameter.

Inside the `build` method, a `Scaffold` widget is returned, which provides a basic structure for the screen. The body of the scaffold is a `Center` widget, which centers its child widgets vertically and horizontally.

Inside the `Center` widget, a `Column` widget is used to arrange multiple child widgets vertically. The main axis alignment of the column is set to `MainAxisAlignment.center`, which centers its children vertically.

The child widgets of the column include an `Icon` widget, a `Text` widget, another `Text` widget, a `SizedBox` widget, and an `ElevatedButton` widget.

The `Icon` widget displays a green checkmark icon. The first `Text` widget displays a success message. The second `Text` widget displays the form number using string interpolation. The `SizedBox` widget adds some vertical spacing.

The `ElevatedButton` widget is used to create a button labeled "Retour" (which means "Return" in French). When the button is pressed, it calls `Navigator.pop(context)` twice to navigate back to the previous screens.
