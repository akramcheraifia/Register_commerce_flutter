
The code defines a Flutter Class called `FailedScreen`. This screen is displayed when a user is unable to submit a new form because their previous form is either pending or has been accepted.

The screen consists of a `Scaffold` widget, which provides a basic structure for the screen. Inside the `Scaffold`, there is a `Center` widget that centers its child vertically and horizontally.

The child of the `Center` widget is a `Column` widget, which allows multiple widgets to be stacked vertically. Inside the `Column`, there are several widgets:

1. An `Icon` widget displaying a cancel icon.
2. A `Padding` widget containing a `Text` widget with a message explaining the reason for the failure.
3. An `ElevatedButton` widget with the label "Retour". When pressed, it pops two screens from the navigation stack using the `Navigator.pop` method.
