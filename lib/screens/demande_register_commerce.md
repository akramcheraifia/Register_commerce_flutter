
1. The code starts with the declaration of a class named `DemandeRegisterCommerce`, which is a StatefulWidget.

2. Inside the `build` method, a `Form` widget is used to create a form with various input fields and a submit button.

3. The form fields include text fields for "Nom de l'entreprise", "Adresse", "Numéro de téléphone", "Email", and "Type d'activité". These fields are wrapped in `TextFormField` widgets and are controlled by corresponding `TextEditingController` instances.

4. The form also includes a date picker field for "Date de naissance" and a checkbox for "Déclaration". These fields are controlled by `_selectedDate` and `_agreeToTerms` variables respectively.

5. The submit button is an `ElevatedButton` widget that triggers the `_submitForm` method when pressed.

6. The `_submitForm` method is responsible for validating the form inputs and submitting the form data to Firestore.

7. Inside the `_submitForm` method, the current user's ID is obtained using `FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser!.uid`.

8. The form document is fetched from Firestore using the user ID.

9. If the form document exists, the form data is checked for its status. If the status is "en attend" or "Accepté", the user is redirected to a failed screen. Otherwise, the user can submit a new form.

10. If the form document doesn't exist, the user can submit a new form.

11. The `_submitFormData` method is responsible for actually submitting the form data to Firestore.

12. Inside the `_submitFormData` method, a new document is created in the "forms" collection with the user ID as the document ID.

13. The form data is stored in the document as key-value pairs.

14. A success message is printed to the console and a success snackbar is shown to the user.

15. Finally, the user is redirected to a successful screen with the form number as a parameter.
