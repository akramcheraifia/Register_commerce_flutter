
This code appears to be a part of a Flutter application. It defines a `SuivreDemandeScreen` widget, which seems to be responsible for displaying a list of submitted forms. 

The widget fetches the submitted forms data from a data source and displays it using a `ListView.builder`. For each form, it creates a `Card` widget with a `ListTile` inside. The `ListTile` displays the form number, status, and submission time. The status is displayed as text and is accompanied by an icon based on its value (e.g., a clock icon for "en attend", a cancel icon for "Rejetée", and a checkmark icon for "Accepté").

When a form is tapped, a dialog box is shown with detailed information about the form. The dialog box contains a `RichText` widget with various text spans to display different form details such as the form number, company name, address, phone number, email, type of activity, and submission date.

The dialog box also includes a "Fermer" button, which closes the dialog when pressed.

If there are no submitted forms, a "No submitted forms" message is displayed in the center of the screen.
