
The code defines a Flutter screen called `FAQPage` that displays a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and their corresponding answers. The screen is implemented using the `Scaffold` widget, which provides a basic layout structure for the screen.

The `AppBar` at the top of the screen contains a back button and a title. The back button allows the user to navigate back to the previous screen, and the title displays the text "Questions fréquemment posées".

The body of the screen is a `ListView` widget that contains a list of `FAQItem` widgets. Each `FAQItem` represents a single FAQ and consists of a question and an answer.

The `FAQItem` widget is implemented as a `Card` with an `ExpansionTile` inside it. The `ExpansionTile` allows the user to expand or collapse the answer section of each FAQ by tapping on the question. The answer section is initially collapsed.

The code also includes a `StatefulWidget` called `_FAQItemState` that manages the state of each `FAQItem`. It keeps track of whether the answer section is expanded or collapsed and updates the UI accordingly.
