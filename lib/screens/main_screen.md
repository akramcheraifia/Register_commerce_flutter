
This code represents the implementation of the `MainScreen` class in a Flutter application. The `MainScreen` is a stateful widget that displays the main screen of the application. It consists of an app bar with a title and a menu button, and a body that contains various buttons for different actions.

The `_MainScreenState` class extends the `State` class and contains the logic for initializing local notifications, listening to changes in a Firestore collection, sending notifications based on the changes, and handling user interactions with the buttons.

The `initializeNotifications` method initializes the FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin and sets the Android initialization settings.

The `listenToChanges` method listens to changes in the Firestore collection 'forms' for the current user and sends notifications based on the changes. If the 'status' field in the document is 'Rejetée', a rejection notification is sent. If the 'status' field is 'Accepté', an acceptance notification is sent.

The `sendNotification` method sends a notification using the FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.

The `dispose` method cancels the subscription to Firestore snapshots when the screen is disposed.

The `build` method builds the UI of the screen using a Scaffold widget. It displays the app bar with a title and a menu button. The body of the screen is a StreamBuilder that listens to changes in the Firestore collection 'users' for the current user. It displays a loading spinner while waiting for data, an error message if something went wrong, a message if the document doesn't exist, or the user's name and various buttons for different actions.
