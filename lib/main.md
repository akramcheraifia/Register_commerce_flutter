The MyApp class is a StatelessWidget that represents the root of the application. It creates a MaterialApp widget, which is a convenience widget that configures the top-level Navigator, theme, and other common widgets. The MaterialApp widget sets the debugShowCheckedModeBanner to false, sets the title of the application to 'RegistreCom Mobile', and applies a custom theme with a blue color scheme. The home property is set to the FirstScreen widget, which will be the initial screen of the application.

Overall, this code sets up the necessary configurations for Firebase and defines the structure of the Flutter application with the main entry point and the root widget.
